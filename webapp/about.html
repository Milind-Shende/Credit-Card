                            <p class="card-text">As we are seeing with the growing number of credit card users, banks & credit card companies are facing an increase in credit card default rate. This increase in defaults creates much impact to the financial companies along with the cardholders and pulls them to losses. As such, data analytics can provide solutions to manage the current phenomenon and management of credit defaults. This project discusses the implementation of a model which predicts if a given credit card holder has a probability of defaulting in the following month, using his demographic data and behavioural data from the past 6 months.</p>

                                <span>Project Title:</span> CreditCard Default Prediction. 
                                <br>This project is about predicting the Defaulter for a Credit Card company based on the past 6 months' user data. 
                                <br><span>Provided:</span> We have provided user account details with Credit card transaction information from April to September(6 months).
                                <br><span>Expected:</span> Based on this past data, we need to predict whether a user will be a Future Defaulter or not.
                                <br><span>Procedure followed: </span>
                                <br>1. Analyzed the data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and gave structure to the data.
                                <br>2. After getting some clarity and information about what data is, then performed Feature Engineering followed by Feature selection. 
                                <br>3. Feature selection was done based on the correlation between features.
                                <br>4. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, some sampling techniques are used to balance the dataset. 
                                <br>5. Using GridSearchCV found the best hyperparameters for the dataset.
                                <br>6. Then, created pipelines for both categorical features and numerical features separately. Then combined into a single pipeline using ColumnTransformer.
                                <br>7. Trained the dataset with various models with the best hyperparameters found.
                                <br>8. Selected the best model by evaluating the model with performance metrics.
                                <br>9. So, by using the best model, we can predict whether a customer will be a Defaulter or not.
                                <br><span>Outcome:</span> Achieved the expected outcome by following all the above steps and obtained an accuracy of 82.1% for the best model.
                                <br><span>Conclusion:</span> Now, we can able to predict whether a user will be a Future Defaulter or not, based on his past 6 months' Credit card information.
