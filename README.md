💳 **Credit Card Default Prediction**

**This is a machine learning model for predicting credit card default. The model uses historical credit card data to determine the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payments.This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.**

📙📙📙 **Dataset Source**

**In our dataset we have 25 columns 30000 Rows which reflect various attributes of the customer. The target column is default.payment.next.month , which reflects whether the customer defaulted or not. Our aim is to predict the probability of default given the payment history of the customer. I have built my model using a public dataset available on kaggle.**
